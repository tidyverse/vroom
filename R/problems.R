#' Retrieve parsing problems
#'
#' vroom will only fail to parse a file if the file is invalid in a way that is
#' unrecoverable. However there are a number of non-fatal problems that you
#' might want to know about. You can retrieve a data frame of these problems
#' with this function.
#'
#' @param x A data frame from `vroom::vroom()`.
#' @param lazy If `TRUE`, just the problems found so far are returned. If
#'   `FALSE` (the default) the lazy data is first read completely and all
#'   problems are returned.
#' @return A data frame with one row for each problem and four columns:
#'   - row,col - Row and column number that caused the problem, referencing the
#'   original input
#'   - expected - What vroom expected to find
#'   - actual - What it actually found
#'   - file - The file with the problem
