# vroom (development version)

* `vroom::problems` can now be called without arguments on `.Last.value` and warning message from parsing problems are more descriptive (#443, https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1322).

* `vroom()` reads more reliably from filepaths containing non-ascii characters, in a non-UTF-8 locale (#394, #438).

* `vroom_format()` and `vroom_write()` only quote values that contain a
  delimiter, quote, or newline. Specifically values that are equal to the `na`
  string (or that start with it) are no longer quoted (#426).
  
* Fixed segfault when reading in multiple files and the first file is header-only but subsequent files have at least one row (#430).

* Fixed segfault when `vroom_format()` is given an empty data frame (#425)

* Fixed a segfault that could occur when the final field of the final line is missing and the file also does not end in a newline (#429).

* Fix recursive gc error that could occur during `vroom_write()` when `output_column()` generates an ALTREP vector (#389).

* `vroom_progress()` uses `rlang::is_interactive()` instead of `base::interactive()`.

* `col_factor(levels = NULL)` honors the `na` strings of `vroom()` and its own `include_na` argument, as described in the docs, and now reproduces the behaviour of readr's first edition parser (#396).

# vroom 1.5.7

* Jenny Bryan is now the official maintainer.

* Fix uninitialized bool detected by CRAN's UBSAN check (https://github.com/r-lib/vroom/pull/386)

# vroom 1.5.6

* `vroom(col_select=)` now works if `col_names = FALSE` as intended (#381)

* `vroom()` no longer issues a spurious warning when the parsing needs to be restarted due to the presence of embedded newlines (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1313)
* Fix performance issue when materializing subsetted vectors (#378)

* `vroom_format()` now uses the same internal multi-threaded code as `vroom_write()`, improving its performance in most cases (#377)

* `vroom_fwf()` no longer omits the last line if it does _not_ end with a newline (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1293)

* Empty files or files with only a header line and no data no longer cause a crash if read with multiple files (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1297)

* Files with a header but no contents, or a empty file if `col_names = FALSE` no longer cause a hang when `progress = TRUE` (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1297)

* Commented lines with comments at the end of lines no longer hang R (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1309)

* Comment lines containing unpaired quotes are no longer treated as unterminated quotations (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1307)

* Values with only a `Inf` or `NaN` prefix but additional data afterwards, like
  `Inform` or no longer inappropriately guessed as doubles (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1319)

* Time types now support `%h` format to denote hour durations greater than 24, like readr (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1312)

* Fix performance issue when materializing subsetted vectors (#378)


# vroom 1.5.5

* `vroom()` now supports files with only carriage return newlines (`\r`). (#360, https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1236)

* `vroom()` now parses single digit datetimes more consistently as readr has done (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1276)

* `VROOM_CONNECTION_SIZE` is now parsed as a double, which supports scientific notation (#364)

* `vroom()` now works around specifying a `\n` as the delimiter (#365, https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/5977)

* `vroom()` no longer crashes if given a `col_name` and `col_type` both less than the number of columns (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1271)

* `vroom()` no longer hangs if given an empty value for `locale(grouping_mark=)` (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1241)

# vroom 1.5.4

* `vroom(col_types=)` now accepts column type names like those accepted by utils::read.table. e.g.
    vroom::vroom(col_types = list(a = "integer", b = "double", c = "skip"))

* `vroom()` now respects the `quote` parameter properly in the first two lines of the file (https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1262)

# vroom 1.5.2

* `vroom()` now supports inputs with unnamed column types that are less than the number of columns (#296)

* `vroom()` now outputs the correct column names even in the presence of skipped columns (#293, [tidyverse/readr#1215](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1215))

* `vroom(num_threads = 1)` will now not spawn any threads.
  This can be used on as a workaround on systems without full thread support.

* Threads are now automatically disabled on non-macOS systems compiling against clang's libc++.
  Most systems non-macOS systems use the more common gcc libstdc++, so this should not effect most users.

# vroom 1.5.1

* Parsers now treat NA values as NA even if they are valid values for the types (#342)

* Element-wise indexing into lazy (ALTREP) vectors now has much less overhead (#344)

# vroom 1.5.0

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Datetime formats used when guessing now match those used when parsing (#240)
