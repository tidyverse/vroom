reference:
- title: Read rectangular files
  desc: >
    These functions parse rectangular files (like csv or fixed-width format)
    into tibbles. They specify the overall structure of the file, and how each
    line is divided up into fields.

- title: Write rectangular files
  desc: >
    These functions write data frames to disk, or to convert them to in-memory strings.

  - output_column

- title: Column specification
  desc: >
    The column specification describes how each column is parsed from a
    character vector in to a more specific data type. vroom does make
    an educated guess about the type of each column, but you'll need override
    those guesses when it gets them wrong.

- title: Locale controls
  desc: >
    The "locale" controls all options that vary from country-to-country or
    language-to-language. This includes things like the character used as
    the decimal mark, the names of days of the week, and the encoding. See
    `vignette("locales")` for more details.

  - locale
  - date_names

- title: Data generation
  desc: >
    vroom provides a number of functions to generate datasets based on a column
    specification. These are mainly used for development and benchmarking, but
    can also be useful for reproducing bugs without requiring the original
    dataset.
  contents:
    - gen_tbl
    - generators

- title: Misc tools
  desc: >
    These functions are used as helpers for other functions, or to inspect objects.
