Literal data useful examples tests. recognised literal data, input must either wrapped (), string containing least one new line, vector containing least one string new line. Using value clipboard() read system clipboard. col_positions Column positions, created fwf_empty(), fwf_widths() fwf_positions(). read selected fields, use fwf_positions(). width last column variable (ragged fwf file), supply last end position NA. col_types One NULL, cols() specification, string. See vignette(\"readr\") details. NULL, column types imputed guess_max rows input interspersed throughout file. convenient (fast), robust. imputation fails, need increase guess_max supply correct types . Column specifications created list() cols() must contain one column specification column. want read subset columns, use cols_only(). Alternatively, can use compact string representation character represents one column: c = character = integer n = number d = double l = logical f = factor D = date T = date time t = time ? = guess _ - = skip default, reading file without column specification print message showing readr guessed . remove message, set show_col_types = FALSE set `options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE). col_select <tidy-select> Columns include results, either name numeric index. Use c() list() select one expression ?tidyselect::language full details selection language. id name column store file path. useful reading multiple input files data file paths, data collection date. NULL (default) extra column created. locale locale controls defaults vary place place. default locale US-centric (like R), can use locale() create locale controls things like default time zone, encoding, decimal mark, big mark, day/month names. na Character vector strings interpret missing values. Set option character() indicate missing values. comment string used identify comments. text comment characters silently ignored. skip_empty_rows blank rows ignored altogether? .e. option TRUE blank rows represented .  FALSE represented NA values columns. trim_ws leading trailing whitespace (ASCII spaces tabs) trimmed field parsing ? skip Number lines skip reading data. n_max Maximum number lines read. guess_max Maximum number lines use guessing column types. See vignette(\"column-types\", package = \"readr\") details. altrep Control column types use Altrep representations, either character vector types, TRUE FALSE. See vroom_altrep() full details. altrep_opts  num_threads number processing threads use initial parsing lazy reading data. data contains newlines within fields parser automatically detect fall back using one thread . However know file newlines within quoted fields safest set num_threads = 1 explicitly. progress Display progress bar? default display interactive session knitting document. automatic progress bar can disabled setting option readr.show_progress FALSE. show_col_types FALSE, show guessed column types.
